# Hunt_The_Wumpus
A java implementation of the Hunt The Wumpus game, which was the final project of my CS231 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course at Colby College. It makes use of a couple of self-made data structures such as Hash Map and Graph, and also adopts some interesting algorithms such as the Dijkstra Algorithm. The background story to the game is: The hunter (the user), is trapped in a labyrinth where there is a lurking wumpus in one of the many rooms. The hunter needs to kill the wumpus by getting to the cell nearby and fire an arrow across the wall. If it misfires then the wumpus will hear the sound and kill the hunter. If the hunter wanders into wumpus' cell, it will also be killed by the wumpus.

The details of the games' rules are as follows:
